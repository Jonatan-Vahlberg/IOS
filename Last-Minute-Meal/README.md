# Last Minute Meal

App created with the purpose of being able to get recepies on the fly based on a few ingredients at home. Brought to life using Spoonaculars wonderful API: [Recipe - Food - Nutrition](https://rapidapi.com/spoonacular/api/recipe-food-nutrition)

The app gets the user request in form of ingredients and to the best of its ability matches 5 recepies from spoonacular to display name, image and link to.

Unfourtunatly as the API has limited usage on a free account but a free API key can be gotten in link above the key will not exsist in the code and need to be replaced.
